    """
Function finding all possible routes from givens start ports and end ports. 
The result of extracted routes can vary based on the prior determined rules such as:

+ No EU or RU ports in the first intermediate ports with a start port from a RU port

+ If a route includes an EU port before arriving to an NL port, the same IMO is used to 
transport oil from e.g. a non EU port->EU port->NL port

Extra rules can be set based on the preference of users such as:
+ Connection time between two trips
+ Circular routes 
+ Ship type
+ Ports of interest

Args:
    start_RU_port (list of strings): a list of RU port names where a route begins.
    These ports were selected based on the highest betweeness centrality
    
    end_port (list of strings): a list of NL/or any port names where a route ends.
    These ports were selected based in the highest betweeness centrality
    
    lowerbound_time (int): in hours, the lower bound of the time interval used
    to find matching IMOs at a shared port
    
    upperbound_time (int) : in hours, the upper bound of the time interval used
    to find matching IMO at a shared port
    
    win_time_slide (int): used to extend the interval time (including lower- and
                        and upper-bound). This parameter allows to extend a constant
                        time distance based on the initial defined interval.
                        If this parameter is deactivated, it functions as a iteration
                        counter for a while-loop
                        
    strike (int): in hours. Similar to the win_time_slide, but it allows to extend
    an inconsistent time distance
    
    iterat_time (int): the total number of iteration time will allow to update 
    and exent the lower- and upper-bound of the time interval used to find new 
    matching IMOs at a shared port
    
    tot_nr_port (int): Total number of ports included in a compete route. The
    minimun total number of ports is 3
    
    outputpath (string): path and name of output file
    
    Graph_whole_dataset: a multi-directed graph containing all ports as nodes and 
    all connections between the ports as edges of the whole data. It was constructed
    using networkx package
    
    port_of_russia (list of string): a list of Russian ports
    
    eu_ports (list of string): a list of ports in EU
    
    port_of_interest (list of string): a list of ports belong to the countries of 
    interest. In this case well-known refinery countries. These ports were selected
    based on the highest betweeness centrality
    
    ru_country (string): name of the country
    
    alltankers_adjusted (dataframe): A dataframe contains all ports of call of 
    all IMOs. It requires to have the follow columns:
        Index
        IMO
        DepPort
        ArrPort
        DepDate
        ArrDate
        Country
        Arr_Country
        ShipType
        
    loop (bool): a boolean input with True: remove all circular routes in a route
    with False keeping all types of routes
    
    loop_type (string): there are two types of loops: port and country.
    A route can contain a port/or country more than once in its sequence
    


Returns:
    final_route_RU_to_NL (list of list): a list of index lists. Each index list
    contains a sequence of a full route. To view all data of the routes, using 
    the original data table (alltanker_adjusted)
